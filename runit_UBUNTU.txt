To run a Python script by double-clicking on Ubuntu, you can create a desktop shortcut. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Python Script:**
   First, create your Python script (e.g., `gene_enrichment_tool.py`) with the desired functionality. Make sure it has the necessary shebang line at the top:

   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   # Your Python script code here
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable:**
   Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing your script, and run:

   ```bash
   chmod +x gene_enrichment_tool.py
   ```

   This command makes the script executable.

3. **Create a Desktop Shortcut:**
   Right-click on your desktop, select "Create a new document," and choose "Empty Document." Open the empty document and add the following content:

   ```desktop
   [Desktop Entry]
   Name=Gene Enrichment Tool
   Exec=/path/to/your/script.py
   Icon=/path/to/your/logo.png
   Type=Application
   Terminal=false
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/script.py` with the actual path to your Python script, and `/path/to/your/logo.png` with the path to your logo.

4. **Save and Make Executable:**
   Save the file with a `.desktop` extension, for example, `Gene_Enrichment_Tool.desktop`. After saving, make the desktop file executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x Gene_Enrichment_Tool.desktop
   ```

   Now, you should be able to double-click on the desktop shortcut to run your Python script.

Please note that the instructions may vary slightly depending on your Ubuntu desktop environment. This guide assumes you're using a standard Ubuntu desktop with a file manager that 
supports desktop shortcuts
